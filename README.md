# Traffic_Volume_Prediction
Our objective of this project is to Build a model that will predict traffic volume for future based on previous traffic volume data . In this process we use XGBoost XBG Regressor algorithm in machine learning using python programming language . Python is open source software to build any  application in machine learning. we also used flask to develop web page.
